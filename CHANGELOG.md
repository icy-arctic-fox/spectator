- Add internal logging that uses Crystal's `Log` utility. Provide the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to enable.
- Support dynamic creation of examples.
- Capture and log information for hooks.
- Tags can be added to examples and example groups.
- Add matcher to check compiled type of values.
- Examples can be skipped by using a `:pending` tag. A reason method can be specified: `pending: "Some excuse"`
- Examples without a test block are marked as pending. [#37](https://gitlab.com/arctic-fox/spectator/-/issues/37)
- Examples can be skipped during execution by using `skip` or `pending` in the example block. [#17](https://gitlab.com/arctic-fox/spectator/-/issues/17)

- Add `filter_run_including`, `filter_run_excluding`, and `filter_run_when_matching` to config block.
- By default, only run tests when any are marked with `focus: true`.
- Add "f-prefix" blocks for examples and groups (`fit`, `fdescribe`, etc.) as a short-hand for specifying `focus: true`.
- Add HTML formatter. Operates the same as the JUnit formatter. Specify `--html_output=DIR` to use. [#22](https://gitlab.com/arctic-fox/spectator/-/issues/22) [#3](https://github.com/icy-arctic-fox/spectator/issues/3)

### Changed
- `given` (now `provided`) blocks changed to produce a single example. `it` can no longer be nested in a `provided` block.
- The "should" syntax no longer reports the source as inside Spectator.
- Short-hand "should" syntax must be included by using `require "spectator/should"` - `it { should eq("foo") }`
- Better error messages and detection when DSL methods are used when they shouldn't (i.e. `describe` inside `it`).
- Prevent usage of reserved keywords in DSL (such as `initialize`).
- The count argument for `sample` and `random_sample` groups must be named (use `count: 5` instead of just `5`).
- Helper methods used as arguments for `sample` and `random_sample` must be class methods.
- Simplify and reduce instanced types and generics. Should speed up compilation times.
- Overhaul example creation and handling.
- Overhaul storage of test values.
- Overhaul reporting and formatting. Cleaner output for failures and pending tests.
- Cleanup and simplify DSL implementation.
- Other minor internal improvements and cleanup.

### Deprecated
- `pending` blocks will behave differently in v0.11.0. They will mimic RSpec in that they _compile and run_ the block expecting it to fail. Use a `skip` (or `xit`) block instead to prevent compiling the example.
- `given` has been renamed to `provided`. The `given` keyword may be reused later for memoization.

### Removed
- Removed one-liner `it`-syntax without braces (block).

### Added
- Add variants `contain_elements` and `have_elements`, which behave like `contain` and `have` matchers except that they take an array (or any enumerable type) instead of a parameter list or splat.
